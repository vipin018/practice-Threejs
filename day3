⚔️ Task 3: Dynamic Materials & Realistic Shadows (Advanced)
💡 Objective:
Create a rich, dynamic scene showcasing material behavior under light — pushing realism and interactivity.

✅ Must-Haves:
6+ Objects using a different material each:

MeshStandardMaterial

MeshPhysicalMaterial

MeshToonMaterial

MeshDepthMaterial

MeshNormalMaterial

MeshBasicMaterial

Dynamic Lighting:

Add a PointLight that moves in real time (circular motion or user-controlled).

Use SpotLight with visible cone + shadows enabled.

Realistic Shadows:

Tweak light.shadow.mapSize, bias, and camera settings for crisp shadows.

Set up a plane floor that receives shadows perfectly.

Ensure all objects cast shadows properly.

GUI Panel:

Add live control of:

light intensity, light color

material roughness, metalness, or clearCoat (for physical material)

shadow darkness

Camera / Control:

OrbitControls with autoRotate toggle

Optional: Add camera zoom effect based on time (GSAP or custom animation)

Animations (GSAP or custom):

Animate at least 3 materials dynamically (e.g., changing roughness, color over time).

Move 2–3 objects in loops to reflect the lighting.

💎 Bonus XP:
Add an HDRI environment map using RGBELoader for material reflections.

Load custom textures (diffuse, roughness, normal maps) on at least one object.

Try a “night mode” toggle via GUI that changes light color and material properties.

🎯 Final Tip:
Make it feel like a scene from a material test lab. Functional, interactive, but also aesthetic.
