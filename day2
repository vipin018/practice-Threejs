🔥 Next Challenge: “3D Object Playground + Animation”
📌 Goal:
Create a 3D scene where:

You have 3–5 different geometries (reuse some from before or new ones).

Each object:

Has a unique material (try MeshStandardMaterial, MeshNormalMaterial, etc.)

Has its own animation (rotate, bounce, pulse, float, scale, etc.)

Is spread out in space using position.

🌟 Bonus Challenges (for flex)
Add a ground plane that receives shadows.

Add shadows to your objects.

Animate one object using GSAP or Tween.js (optional, just for fun).

Add a colorful background or sky-like gradient.

💡 Skill Focus:
material experimentation

basic animation logic

positioning objects in 3D space

light/shadow interaction

small touch of motion design!

If you want a name for this scene:
📦 “The Object Parade” or 🎡 “3D Funfair”
