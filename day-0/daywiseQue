📅 Week 1 - Three.js Beginner Practice Plan
🟢 Day 1: Setting Up & Rendering a Basic 3D Object
Topics: Scene, Camera, Renderer, Mesh, Geometry, Materials

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Set up a basic Three.js scene with a PerspectiveCamera and WebGLRenderer.
2️⃣ Create a cube and add it to the scene.
3️⃣ Change the cube’s color and size.
4️⃣ Adjust the camera position to view the cube properly.

💡 Bonus: Try adding a different shape like a sphere or torus.

🟢 Day 2: Lights & Shadows
Topics: AmbientLight, PointLight, DirectionalLight, Shadows

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Add AmbientLight and observe its effect.
2️⃣ Add PointLight and move it around.
3️⃣ Experiment with DirectionalLight and enable shadows.
4️⃣ Add a plane beneath the object and make shadows visible.

💡 Bonus: Try adjusting the intensity and color of the lights.

🟢 Day 3: Object Transformations (Rotation, Scaling, Movement)
Topics: Position, Rotation, Scale

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Move the cube to different positions using .position.set(x, y, z).
2️⃣ Rotate the cube continuously in an animation loop.
3️⃣ Scale the cube dynamically.

💡 Bonus: Try animating the object’s position or scale using requestAnimationFrame().

🟢 Day 4: Adding Interactivity (Mouse & Keyboard Events)
Topics: Raycasting, Event Listeners

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Change the cube’s color when clicked using Raycaster.
2️⃣ Move the cube left and right using the arrow keys (keydown event).
3️⃣ Make the cube disappear when clicked.

💡 Bonus: Add multiple cubes and allow interactions with all of them.

🟢 Day 5: Camera Controls & User Interaction
Topics: OrbitControls, Camera Movement

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Implement OrbitControls to rotate around the object using the mouse.
2️⃣ Add a button to change the camera position (front, side, top views).
3️⃣ Make the cube move towards the camera when the W key is pressed.

💡 Bonus: Animate the camera movement smoothly.

🟢 Day 6: Textures & Materials
Topics: TextureLoader, StandardMaterial, Normal Maps

✅ Tasks:
1️⃣ Load a brick or wood texture onto a cube using TextureLoader().
2️⃣ Apply a shiny material using MeshStandardMaterial().
3️⃣ Add a normal map to give depth to the texture.

💡 Bonus: Try using a transparent PNG as a texture.

🟢 Day 7: Building a Mini Scene (Combining Everything!)
Topics: Everything learned so far

✅ Final Project:
🔹 Create a simple table scene with:

A wooden table (cube with texture)

A rotating lamp (cylinder + point light)

A sphere on the table that can be moved with arrow keys

Interactive lighting that turns on/off when clicked

💡 Bonus: Add animations to make it feel more alive!
